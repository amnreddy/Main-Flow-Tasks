Data Analysis Task 1: Data Analysis Project Using Python

Description:  Analyze a dataset of student exam scores and answer specific questions, presenting findings using Python libraries and techniques for data analysis.

Resposibilties: This task focuses on analyzing a dataset and extracting meaningful insights through data cleaning, visualization, and modeling.

Step by step Process:

Step 1:Import Libraries like  
-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-numpy: For numerical computations.
-matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.

Step 2: Data Loading and Data Exploaration 
-The dataset is loaded using pandas.
-The first few rows are displayed using .head() to understand its structure.
-Used .info() to check data types and missing values.
-Used .describe() for statistical summaries of numerical columns.

Step 3: Data Cleaning
-Handled missing values by either filling them (fillna) or dropping them (dropna).
-Detected and removed outliers using boxplots.

Step 4: Data Analysis on different questions
* Calculate the average score in math (G3).
* Howmanystudents scored above 15 in their final grade (G3)
* Is there a correlation between study time (study time) and the final grade (G3)?
* Which gender has a higher average final grade (G3)?
  
Step 5: Data Visualization
1. Plot a histogram of final grades (G3).
2. Create a scatter plot between study time (study time) and final grade (G3).
3. Create a bar chart comparing the average scores of male and female students.
